TODO

=== P1 ====

Support list views - these should map to CouchDB Views with subscriptions to the changes api

Support passing in multiple items to getView
	fin.getView('<div class="dueDate">(( user.task.dueDate ))</div><div class="messageSender">(( message.sender.name ))', {
		user: userItem,
		message: messageItem
	})



=== P2 ====

Database: Remove the nested properties object - should just be reading directly off of the document

Property chaining depends alot on recursive calls modifying the property chain, which requires a bunch of dependancyChain.slice(0) copying of the dependancy chain array. Should use loops instead, without modifying the propertyChain




=== P3 ====

Look over API again - would be nice to have something like fin.applyToElement

Add drag and drop support to lists
