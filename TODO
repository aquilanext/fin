TODO

Look over API again - would be nice to have something like fin.applyToElement

Add drag and drop support to lists

When referencing an object that doesn't exist yet, create it automatically and update the reference to point to the new object

Database: Remove the nested properties object - should just be reading directly off of the document

Property chaining depends alot on recursive calls modifying the property chain, which requires a bunch of dependancyChain.slice(0) copying of the dependancy chain array. Should use loops instead, without modifying the propertyChain

Support passing in multiple items to getView
	fin.getView('<div class="dueDate">(( user.task.dueDate ))</div><div class="messageSender">(( message.sender.name ))', {
		user: userItem,
		message: messageItem
	})
