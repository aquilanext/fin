alpha
	(?) templates should say the type of item references, also possibly which template to use to render it
	mutations!
	split panels
	animate planels
	keystroke handling
	email + password => labels

storage
	X create db
	User => labels
	label => view over items
	every now and then, dump items to database

mutations
	keystroke generates diff - publish
	Server puts diff in message queue
	itemFactory applies mutation to item
	connection publishes mutation
	clients apply mutation and update ui

beta
	filtered pubsub?
	
Demo
 	a corner of the screen is a mini-version of the UI, driven by computer. Simulates doing actions, which are reflected in users UI. Uses FE pubsub of items only - no BE
